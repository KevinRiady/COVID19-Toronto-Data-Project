    " - Includes cases that are sporadic (occurring in the community) and outbreak-associated.\n",
    " - Data are extracted from provincial communicable disease reporting system (iPHIS) and Toronto's custom COVID-19 case management system (CORES). \n",
    " - Link: \n",

    "2. Key questions to explore and answer from this dataset.\n",
    " - What is the age group that is most affected? \n",
    "  - Histogram.\n",
    " - **Visual map showcasing number of cases in each neighbourhood**\n",
    " - Machine learning: classification - what population set has the highest likelihood of contracting the virus? \n",
    "  - We know something about age. \n",
    "  - Does location matter? Which neighborhood has been most affected?\n",
    "  - What about income?\n",
    " - Source of infection: Which source is contributing the most to Canada's COVID-19 cases?\n",
    " - How many confirmed cases? How many probable cases?\n",
    " - What are the average episode dates? (time between when disease was acquired to the symptom onset/lab specimen collection date/ reported date.\n",
    " - Does sex matter?\n",
    " - What are the individual outcomes of each case? % fatal, resolved, and active.\n",
    " - How many have been hospitalized? In ICU? Intubated?\n",

    "4. How can we apply machine learning methodologies to this dataset?\n",
    " - DecisionTree, RandomForest, Ensemble Learning, Grid Search, Random Search. This is more of a classification project."
